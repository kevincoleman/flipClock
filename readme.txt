This clock page is something I created because no flip clock screen savers would work on my version of OSX. I searched around and found some other options, but nothing that I liked or that worked well. Please feel free to use this clock in any environment you wish (with the exception of selling my work, of course...).

I suggest using it as I doâ€”as a screensaver via websaver (http://code.google.com/p/websaver/) or an equivalent web-to-screensaver solution. You can either clone this to your computer and point websaver to the local path or just point websaver to my hosted version at:

12-hour: http://colemantest.com/flipClock
24-hour: http://colemantest.com/flipClock?format=24

Because this is really just a replacement for my OSX screensaver, I built and tested in a Webkit-rendered environment (what Safari and Chrome use). No guarantees on other rendering engines.

* It appears as though the current version of Chrome (OSX 24.0.1312.57) has just rolled back support of the backface-visibility property, so until they update to support it again, I suggest using Safari. Luckily, this is what websaver uses for displaying the page as a screensaver, so it works in that context.

Enjoy!
